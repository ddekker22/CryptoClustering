# CryptoClustering

### Background
This module is located in the file Crypto_Clustering.ipynb. Code for this module was learned from in-class examples and the documentation for composite plots. I decided to use the * form of composite plots for comparison of the elbow curves, to simplify readability. I also included the + form of the composite plots to satisfy the conditions of the assignment.
